            <B>SUMMARY:</B> <br>
            <em>volleyball</em> <small>game played</small> by two teams, usually of six players on a side,in which the players use their
            hands to bat a ball back and forth over a high net,trying to make the ball touch the court within 
            opponentsâ€™playing area before it can be returned. <br><br>To prevent this a player on the opposing team bats
            the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surfaceâ€”that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate who volleys it across the net.
            A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before it must be returned over the net.<br>

            <strong>THE GAME:</strong> <BR>
            Volleyball requires a minimum of equipment and space and can be played indoors or outdoors. The game is
            played on a smooth-surfaced court 9 metres (30 feet) wide by 18 metres (60 feet) long, divided by a
            centre line into two equal areas, one of which is selected by or assigned to each of the two competing 
            teams. Players may not step completely beyond the centre line while the ball is in play. A line 3 
            (10 feet) from and parallel to the centre line of each half of the court indicates the point in front of
            which a back court player may not drive the ball over the net from a position above the top of the net. 
            (This offensive action, called a spike, or kill, is usually performed most effectively and with greatest
            power near the net by the forward line of players.) A tightly stretched net is placed across the court 
            exactly above the middle of the centre line; official net heights (measured from the top edge of the net
            (7.4 feet) for women. Further adjustments in net height can be made for young people and others who

           <blockqoute>"Over the years, I realized that if I'd done everything possible to prepare myself for matches and tournaments, it took a weight off my shoulders and allowed me to play without fear of losing. When you've done everything you can to train yourself for competition, you'll sleep well when the tournament is over, win or lose." -- Karch Kiraly</blockqoute>
